                                    who meet Nisab threshold. 2.5% of their wealth must then be given. Zakah must only
                                    be given to the specific eight categories mentioned in the Qur’an. If it is not
                                    given to any of them, then it will be void and necessary to re-pay. So donate to

                                    This is a charity which is a duty upon every sane Muslim, who possesses the value of
                                    Nisab beyond the basic necessities. Fathers are instructed to give Sadaqah al-Fitr

                                    like. This does not mean that a person must distribute wheat or barley, one may give
                                    its equivalent value. (Because this fluctuates it is improper to specify a price,
                                    although it is usually between one and three pounds.)

                                    Sadaqah al-Fitr is a very emphasized Sunnah (which according to many is the status

                                    a few days before ‘Eid so that the poor actually receive it and are able to spend it
                                    on `Eid day. If one does not give the Sadaqah al-Fitr, it will remain due no matter
                                    how much time passes after ‘Eid.

                                    The amount for each missed Salah or Sawm, or each minor mistake in Hajj is to give

                                    poor. Fidyah is generally Sadaqah Wajibah. Sadaqah Nafilah may be given in addition

                                    sacrifices each. In the event of living in a wealthy country, it is better that one
                                    sacrifices one part locally to fulfil the Sunnah of sacrificing oneself; and to
                                    arrange for the remaining sacrifices to be performed in a poorer country, where the
                                    poor may also partake of it.

                                    Dam is of two types. one is like Udhiyyah in the sense that it is a religious
                                    requirement on adult Muslims. The only difference is that it is specific to people
                                    who are performing Hajj. This Dam is called Dam ash-Shukr.

                                    The second type of Dam, like fidyah, is a means of compensation for mistakes in
                                    Hajj, but the difference is the magnitude of the mistake. Fidyah is given in lieu of
                                    minor mistakes while Dam is in lieu of major mistakes. Dam, like Udhiyyah, is the
                                    sacrifice of a sheep or goat. It can also be made a part (i.e. 1/7) of a larger
                                    sacrifice.

                                    Badanah is like Dam, but while Dam is the sacrifice of a sheep or goat, Badanah is
                                    the sacrifice of a large animal, i.e. a cow or camel. This is the largest penalty in
                                    Hajj, and is specific to three acts.

                                    This is charity which is not binding in nature but is optional. This type includes
                                    alms given for the removal of difficulties, philanthropic (to give out of mercy to
                                    the less fortunate), the general giving of any Halal item to any one etc. This type
                                    does not need to be spent on the specified categories to be rewarding nor does it
                                    have to be spent on Muslims, although if spent on poor Muslims it would be more
                                    rewarding. This can also be bequeathed in one’s will (in which case it would be only
                                    up to a third of the deceased person’s entire estate).

                                    This is to allot something as a trust for a certain cause. This can be during one’s

                                    When executed, the donation becomes the property of Allah (and thus has specific
                                    rules regarding it), and its beneficiaries are to remain those named as the cause
                                    (e.g. the poor, orphans, students, the people of a certain locality, etc.) The
                                    difference between this and Lillah is that with Waqf ownership is not given to
                                    people or institutes but only the benefits are ascribed. Like today’s trusts, Waqf
                                    also requires the care of trustees over it.

                                    intentions, is always accepted by Allah. It is also this type that Allah I has
                                    described as a beautiful debt, as He treats this charity as a loan which He will

                                    This literally means to give a good loan. In the language of the Qur’an this term is
                                    used for Sadaqah Nafilah. The rewards of Qardh Hasan are thus exclusive to Sadaqah.
                                    Loans given to Islamic institutes and then forgiven become this type of Sadaqah.
                                    Presently, this term is often used to denote Qardh.

                                        Qardh This means an Islamic loan. Islamic here means that two things must be
                                        upheld from the side of the creditor: the first that neither interest can be
                                        charged nor any other benefit (advantage or gifts) be taken in lieu of the loan;
                                        the second is that at no time can the creditor show any signs of self-glory, or
                                        remind the debtor of the favour/help given (this does not mean that he/she
                                        cannot ask for payment). This type of loan may be given to either an individual
                                        or an institute, and if the conditions are upheld, it is immensely rewarding for
                                        the creditor.

                                    In Islam the taking and also giving of interest have been expressly forbidden. This
                                    presents problems in secular countries, wherein no loan or mortgage is ever done
                                    without it. In so far as taking loans which charge interest are concerned, it can
                                    only be said that unless it is a life-or-death situation one must stay away from
                                    such loans, to avoid the Wrath of Allah.

                                        This issue is also something that unfortunately affects many of us. What is
                                        established is that it is not at all permissible for one to utilise this for
                                        one’s own benefit. To avoid the anger of Allah, one should give the interest
                                        money accumulated to charity. This, whilst being the most practically beneficial
                                        way of disposing the money, is not going to be positively rewarding. But due to
                                        it being in accordance with Allah’s Will, in that this method of disposal saves
                                        one from further sin, it is still beneficial.
